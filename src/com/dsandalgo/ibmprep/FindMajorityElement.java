		 * Question -> Find the majority element in the array. 
		 * A majority element in an array All of size n is an element that appears more than n/2 times (
		 * and hence there is at most one such element).		 * 
		 * Input : array1= {3, 3, 4, 2, 4, 4, 2, 4, 4} 
		 * Output : 4 
		 * Explanation: The frequency of 4 is 5 which is greater than the half of the size of the array size.
		 * 
		 * Input : array2 = {3, 3, 4, 2, 4, 4, 2, 4}
		 * Output : No Majority Element
		 * Explanation: There is no element whose frequency is greater than half of the size of array.
